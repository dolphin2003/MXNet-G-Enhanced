# End-to-End Deep Learning Tutorial for Kaggle NDSB-II

In this example, we will demo how to use MXNet to build an end-to-end deep learning system to help Diagnose Heart Disease.  The demo network is able to achieve 0.039222 CRPS on validation set, which is good enough to get Top-10 (on Dec 22nd, 2015).

Notice this is a very simple model with no attempt to optimize the structure or hyper parameters, you can build fantastic network based on it. Wh
