    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will go through the basic use case of MXNet and also touch on some advanced usages. This example is based on the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of hand written characters with 28-by-28 pixel size.\n",

    "This tutorial covers the following topics:\n",
    "- network definition.\n",
    "- Variable naming.\n",
    "- Basic data loading and training with feed-forward deep neural networks.\n",
    "- Monitoring intermediate outputs for debuging.\n",
    "- Custom training loop for advanced models."
